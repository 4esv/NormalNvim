nvim

## Plugins

WIP

## Distro features

* Lazy: Plugins are loaded lazily, providing super fast startup times.
* Plugin version lock: Options to choose between locking your plugin versions, or go bleeding edge and have the latest updates.
* Rollbacks: You can easily recover from a nvim distro update using :NvimRollbackRestore
* You are in control: This distro don't abstract stuff from you. Instead, code comments guide you to easily customize your stuff.

## Credits
Originally it took AstroVim as base. But implements [this VIM config](https://github.com/Zeioth/vim-zeioth-config). Code has been simplified while retaining its core features.
