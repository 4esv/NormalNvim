# NormalNVim
A normal NeoVim config

## What is this
This NeoVim distro is esentially AstroVim de-branded and simplified.

## Changes from vanila AstroVim

* Distro updates removed → I consider this is not a good idea. A text editor is not an operative system that needs to be updated that often. And it could lead to unestability. You can still update Mason and plugins. In the case of plugins it is encouraged to just check the status and then manually the ones you require, as this operation may produce breaking changes.
* Less config files → A NeoVim distro should be easy to customize by the final user.

## Extra plugins

* Ranger instead of NeoTree → More powerful file search
* Gitui → An actual terminal git client
